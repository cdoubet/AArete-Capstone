# Aarete Capstone Project – Healthcare Spending & Health Outcomes

## Overview
This project was developed as part of our capstone experience in partnership with Aarete. Our goal was to explore the relationship between state-level healthcare spending and key health indicators—such as death rate, obesity, and smoking rates—to identify trends, disparities, and opportunities for improvement within the U.S. healthcare system.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into three main folders:

- **Presentation**: Contains the final PowerPoint presentation and the poster we created to showcase our findings.
- **Process**: Includes all datasets, code files, and working documents used throughout the data analysis and visualization process.
- **Report**: Features our executive summary, which highlights our approach, key takeaways, and recommendations.

## Data Collection & Preparation
We began by sourcing multiple publicly available datasets from reputable institutions such as the CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Each dataset covered different aspects of healthcare, including:

- Total healthcare spending per capita
- Death rates per 100,000 residents
- Obesity and smoking prevalence
- Population figures and regional demographics

We cleaned each dataset to ensure consistency and reliability, then merged them based on common fields: **state** and **year**. This allowed us to create a unified dataset for multi-variable analysis over time.

## Tools & Methodology
Our analysis utilized two primary platforms:

- **Tableau**: For exploratory data analysis and visualizations. We created interactive dashboards to better understand the relationship between spending and health outcomes across different regions.
- **Orange Data Mining**: To apply machine learning techniques, generate correlation matrices, and further support our insights with data-driven evidence.

Through these tools, we identified regional disparities—particularly in the Southeastern U.S.—and developed data-backed recommendations for healthcare investment strategies.

## Executive Summary
The executive summary, located in the **Report** folder, provides a high-level overview of our findings. It outlines our approach, main conclusions, and suggestions for how states might better allocate their healthcare resources based on observed trends and peer benchmarking.
